# ResumeWizard

Since building and updating a resume seems to be a hassle nowadays, I think I'll start a pet project to import general data(education, work history, skills), flag each item with tags that best represent the area of interest (frontend, backend, full-stack, ci/cd) and have the builder create personalized resumes for each area of interest.
